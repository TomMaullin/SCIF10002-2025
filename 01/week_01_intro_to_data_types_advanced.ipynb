This notebook is designed for students who already have substantial experience with Python and feel confident working with both the [`Beginner`](./week_01_intro_to_data_types_beginner.ipynb) and [`Intermediate`](./week_01_intro_to_data_types_intermediate.ipynb) material.  \n",

Before beginning, you must have attempted at least $4$ exercises from both the [`Beginner`](./week_01_intro_to_data_types_beginner.ipynb) and [`Intermediate`](./week_01_intro_to_data_types_intermediate.ipynb) notebooks. If you have not done so, please return to those notebooks first, as the material here builds directly on those foundations.  \n",

    "In Python, all data types can be described as either \"immutable\" or \"mutable\".\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand the difference between \"immutable\" and \"mutable\" types, it may be useful to introduce the notion of a *reference*. You can think of a *reference* as an address which tells us where some data lives physically on a machine. When we talk about variables, we really are talking about *reference*'s (which we have named) that point us to some data in memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you reassign the value of a variable in your code, there are actually two possible things that could be happening. The *reference* could be changed (i.e. the variable now represents a different place in memory), or the data itself could be changed (i.e. the variable is still \"looking\" at the same location in memory, but the data that is stored there has changed).\n",
    "\n",
    "What is important to know here is that when you change the value of a variable which has an \"immutable\" data type you are changing a *reference* whereas when you are changing \"mutable\" variables you are changing the data itself. Examples of mutable data types in Python include the `list`, `dictionary` and the `set`. On the other hand, examples of immutable data types are given by the `int`, `float`, `decimal`, `bool` and the `tuple`. In general, the more complicated data types discussed so far are \"mutable\". \n",
    "\n",
    "The distinction between a data type being \"mutable\" or \"immutable\" may seem dull and/or trivial but, in practice, can result in some very unexpected behaviour, especially when multiple variables are using the same *reference* (i.e. \"looking\" at the same place in memory)!\n",

    "**Question 5:** In digital images, colors are represented using *RGB* values. An *RGB* value is a 3-tuple `(r, g, b)` that gives the intensity of the **r**ed, **g**reen, and **b**lue components of a color, each ranging from $0$ to $255$. For example, $(255, 0, 0)$ is bright red, $(0, 255, 0)$ is bright green, and $(0, 0, 0)$ is black.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a program that takes an `(r, g, b)` tuple as input and uses a match statement to classify the tuple into one of the following color names:\n",
    "\n",
    " - `Red` if `r` is greater than `200` and both `g` and `b` are less than `50`.\n",
    " - `Green` if `g` is greater than `200` and both `r` and `b` are less than `50`.\n",
    " - `Blue` if `b` is greater than `200` and both `r` and `g` are less than `50`.\n",
    " - `Unknown` for any other combination.\n",
    "\n",
    "The color name should be saved as a string variable named `color_name`. Write your solution in the box below."

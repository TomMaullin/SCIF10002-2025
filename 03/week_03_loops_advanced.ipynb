This notebook is designed for students who already have substantial experience with writing loops in Python and are confidence on the material from the [`Beginner`](./week_03_loops_beginner.ipynb) and [`Intermediate`](./week_03_loops_intermediate.ipynb) material.  \n",

Before beginning, you must have attempted at least $4$ exercises from both the [`Beginner`](./week_02_loops_beginner.ipynb) and [`Intermediate`](./week_02_loops_intermediate.ipynb) notebooks. If you have not done so, please return to those notebooks first, as the material here builds directly on the `Beginner` material and is substantially more complex than the `Intermediate`.  \n",

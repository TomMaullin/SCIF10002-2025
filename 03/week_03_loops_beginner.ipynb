If you are new to Python, please choose this *Beginner* notebook. You will have plenty of opportunities later in the course to explore the other levels.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you will be introduced to `loop`s. In particular, you will learn what an `iterator`, `iterable`, `for` loop and `while` loop are. Loops are fundamental to coding as they allow you to automatically repeat computations on a large scale.\n",

These exercises test your understanding of the NumPy concepts covered in the introduction notebook.


## Exercise 1: Import and Basic Array Creation

**Task:** Import NumPy with the standard `import` command and create a NumPy array from the list `[2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12]`. Print the array, its data type, and its shape.

```{python}
# Your code here
```

## Exercise 2: Array Indexing and Slicing

**Task:** Using the array you created in Exercise 1:
- Print the first element
- Print the last element
- Print elements from index 2 to 4 (inclusive of 2, exclusive of 5)
- Print every second element

```{python}
# Your code here
```

## Exercise 3: Element-wise Operations

**Task:** Create a NumPy array `arr = np.array([1, 4, 9, 16, 25])`. Perform the following operations and print the results:
- Multiply each element by 3
- Add 10 to each element
- Calculate the square root of each element
- Apply the sine function to each element

```{python}
# Your code here
```

## Exercise 4: Array Operations with Two Arrays

**Task:** Create two NumPy arrays:
- `arr1 = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])`
- `arr2 = np.array([10, 20, 30, 40, 50])`

Perform element-wise operations and print the results:
- Add the two arrays
- Subtract arr1 from arr2
- Multiply the two arrays
- Divide arr2 by arr1

```{python}
# Your code here
```

## Exercise 5: Shape Mismatch Error

**Task:** Create two arrays with different lengths:
- `arr_a = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])`
- `arr_b = np.array([10, 20])`

Try to add these arrays together. What happens? Write the code and explain the error in a comment.

```{python}
# Your code here
```

## Exercise 6: Reductive Operations

**Task:** Create a NumPy array `data = np.array([12, 8, 15, 3, 7, 20, 11, 9])`. Calculate and print:
- The sum of all elements
- The mean (average) of all elements
- The maximum value
- The minimum value
- The standard deviation

```{python}
# Your code here
```

## Exercise 7: Array Manipulation

**Task:** Create a NumPy array `numbers = np.array([5, 2, 8, 1, 9, 3])`. Perform the following operations:
- Sort the array and print the result
- Calculate the cumulative sum and print the result
- Create a new array with duplicates: `with_duplicates = np.array([5, 2, 8, 1, 9, 3, 5, 2, 1])` and find the unique elements

```{python}
# Your code here
```

## Exercise 8: List vs NumPy Comparison

**Task:** Compare the flexibility of lists vs NumPy arrays:
1. Create a Python list containing mixed data types: `mixed_list = [1, 'hello', 3.14, True]`
2. Try to create a NumPy array from this list. What happens to the data types?
3. Create a list of numbers: `num_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
4. Try to multiply the entire list by 2 using `num_list * 2`. What happens?
5. Create a NumPy array from the same numbers and multiply by 2. Compare the results.

```{python}
# Your code here
```

## Exercise 9: Performance Comparison

**Task:** Compare the performance of list comprehension vs NumPy operations:
1. Import the `time` module
2. Create a range of 50,000 numbers using numpy `np.arange()`
3. Time how long it takes to square each number using a **list comprehension**, i.e. the syntax `[x**2 for x in myarray]`
4. Time how long it takes to square each number using NumPy operations
5. Calculate and print how many times faster the NumPy operation is

```{python}
# Your code here
```

## Exercise 10: Complex Operations

**Task:** Create a NumPy array representing angles in degrees: `angles_deg = np.array([0, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 180])`
1. Convert these angles to radians (hint: multiply by π/180, use `np.pi`)
2. Calculate the sine and cosine of each angle
3. Verify that sin²(x) + cos²(x) = 1 for each angle (use `np.sin()` and `np.cos()`)
4. Print all results

```{python}
# Your code here
```

```{python}
# Your code here
```

## Challenge Exercise: Temperature Conversion

**Task:** You have temperature readings in Celsius: `celsius_temps = np.array([0, 10, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40])`

1. Convert all temperatures to Fahrenheit using the formula: F = (C × 9/5) + 32
2. Convert all temperatures to Kelvin using the formula: K = C + 273.15
3. Calculate the temperature range (max - min) for each scale

```{python}
# Your code here
```
